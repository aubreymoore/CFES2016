Insect Diagnostic Services 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an extension entomologist, a major part of my job is providing insect
 identification and pest control recommendations to a diverse clientele
 including commercial growers, gardeners, householders, GovGuam and federal
 agency personnel, and University of Guam colleagues.
 Most client contacts are initiated by a phone call or a visit by the client
 to the ANR office.
 In many cases identification and pest control recommendations require a
 site visit by me and/or extension associates to collect samples to define
 the problem and develop recommendations.
 In some cases, I am sent digital images of insects and damage caused by
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Detection and Documentation of Invasive Species 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with any other tropical island, Guam is extremely susceptible to environmenta
l and economic damage by invasive species.
 Despite this fact, Guam's biosecurity is very weak and invasive species,
 many of them insects, are arriving at unprecedented rates.
 Bioinvasions are grossly under-reported for several reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Professional capacity is lacking.
 Twenty years ago, there were 9 PhD level entomologists practising in Micronesia.
 Only 2 remain (Moore, Miller), despite an increased workload largely due
 to arrival of the cycad scale, coconut rhinoceros beetle and little fire
 ant and other invasive species of insects.
 UOG typically has 4 entomologists.
 We now have 2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We suffer from the 
\emph on
taxonomic impediment
\emph default
.
 The two remaining PhD level entomologists are generalists without the skills
 and resources for species determination of most insect groups.
 Timely and accurate species determination is a necessary first step in
 response to a new pest invasion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is no ongoing biological survey of Guam with the goal of establishing
 a baseline biodiversity inventory and detecting newly arrived invasive
 species.
 Unfortunately, CAPS surveys are usually focused on demonstrating absence
 of specific agricultural pests rather than detecting new invasions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even when invasive species are detected and properly identified, first island
 records are not documented and the information is not published in the
 scientific press.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an attempt to improve this situation, I have set myself up as a 
\emph on
registrar
\emph default
 for new insect species arriving on Guam with the intent of properly documenting
 the ongoing bioinvasion of Guam.
 The procedure I am trying to establish is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First detector sends me a digital image and/or specimen 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specimens are prepared and accessioned into the UOG insect collection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A fact sheet is prepared using a template for Guam New Invasive Species
 Alerts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The fact sheet is distributed to a list of stakeholders
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Taxonomic assistance is obtained for an authoritative species determination.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A journal article is prepared and published in a refereed scientific journal.
 At this point the new geographical distribution data become available to
 the scientific community via the Global Biodiversity Facility (GBIF).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although I have been able to generate about a dozen invasive species alerts
 over the past years, only one new island record has made it into a peer
 reviewed journal.

Guam Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle Project 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Planned Activity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is currently my largest and most time consuming project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected on Guam in the Tumon
 Beach hotel area on September 11, 2007.
 CRB is a very serious pest of coconut palms.
 Adult beetles may kill coconuts and other palms when they bore into the
 crowns to feed on sap.
 When CRB invaded Palau during the Second World War, it killed about half
 of all coconuts through the islands and totally exterpated the coconut
 palm from some of them.
 A delimitation survey indicated that the Guam infestation was limited to
 Tumon Bay and the adjacent Faifai Beach.
 In consultation with the Guam Department of Agriculture (GDOA), USDA-APHIS,
 and USDA-Forest Survey, it was decided to launch an eradication project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wrote the original eradication plan and this was funded by USDA and local
 funds.
 USDA provided funds under the condition that the poject was to be run under
 an Incident Command System with the USDA-APHIS Guam Port Director as the
 federal commander, and the GDOA Director, or designee, as the local commander.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My original role was to provide scientific/technical support for the project,
 with the Guam Department of Agriculture (GDOA) providing project management
 with assistance from USDA-APHIS and USDA-Forest Service.
 However, it soon became apparent that GDOA had serious bureaucratic impediments
 which prevented hiring staff and procuring supplies and equipment within

Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB) Biocontrol

 Guam's forests 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 An uncontrolled outbreak of CRB is rapidly killing these trees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB has been invading Pacific Islands for more than 100 years.
 If left unchecked, CRB has the potential to kill all of the coconut palms
 on an island.
 Tree mortality occurs when adult beetles destroy the growing tip of a palm
 when they bore into the crown to feed on sap.
 Immature beetles (grubs), which feed on decaying vegetation, do no damage.
 In a worst case scenario adult CRB become so abundant that they kill large
 numbers of palms.
 These dead palms become breeding sites which generate even more adult beetles
 which kill even more palms.
 This positive feedback loop may be initiated by an increased availability
 of CRB breeding sites in massive amounts of decaying vegetation left behind
 in the wake of a typhoon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to the CRB invasion of Guam, this pest was effectively controlled
 wherever it has established by introduction of oryctes nudivirus (OrNV)
 as a classical biocontrol agent.
 OrNV is a selective insect pathogen which only kills rhinoceros beetles
 (Subfamily Dynastinae).
 The disease it causes spreads naturally through a population.
 OrNV is a positively density-dependent biocontrol agent, meaning that it
 attacks a higher proportion of individuals at higher population densities.
 After introduction of OrNV into a CRB population, damage to coconut palms
 drops by as much as 90% and population suppression is sustained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Attempts to control CRB using OrNV have failed for the first time on Guam.
 Recent research by Sean Marshall at AgResearch New Zealand and myself indicates
 that Guam has been invaded by a new biotype, CRB-Guam, which is genetically
 distinct from other other populations of CRB and is resistant to all 8
 isolates of OrNV available in cell culture.
 Thus we have lost the major biocontrol agent for controlling CRB on Pacific
 islands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CRB-Guam has so far been detected in Guam, Hawaii, Palau, and the Port Moresby
 area of Papua New Guinea and this virus-resistant biotype is likely to
 spread further unless populations are suppressed.
 This is a regional problem for Pacific islands and trading partners.
 Unconstrained population outbreaks of CRB-Guam following typhoons will
 lead to high levels of local damage to palms and increased risk of accidental
 export of CRB-Guam to other other islands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mapping the geographical extent of CRB-Guam and searching for a strain of
 OrNV which is highly pathogenic for this biotype should be a priority.
 Although the Guam CRB Project has developed improved management tools for
 CRB, these are not sufficient to maintain CRB population levels at acceptable
 levels on an island-wide basis.

the island was invaded by the cycad aulacaspis scale (CAS), 
\shape italic
Aulacaspis yasumatsui
\shape default
 (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) in 2003 (Marler and Lawrence, 2012).
 Prior to this invasion, 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 was the most numerous plant in Guam's forests with a stem diameter greater
 than five inches (Donnegan et al.
 2004).
 The CAS infestation was so severe that by 2006 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of
 Nature (Marler et al., 2006).
 This ecological disaster is still unfolding.
 Marler and Lawrence (2012) predict extirpation of wild cycads on Guam by
 2019 if current trends persist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CAS, described by Takagi (1977), is considered a minor pest of Cycas within
 its native Asian range (Anonymous 2006a), presumably as a result of natural
 biological control organisms.
 Outside of its native range, where CAS has escaped its natural enemies,
 it is a very serious pest of Cycas.
 This scale insect infests all parts of the plant including roots and reproducti
ve structures.
 CAS is small enough to invade minute cracks and crevices where it is undetectab
le during quarantine inspections (Marler and Moore 2010).
 In the absence of chemical or biological control, infested plants become
 totally encrusted with multiple layers of CAS within a few months and die
 within a year (Anonymous 2006a).
 Accidental introduction of CAS to Florida in the 1990s (Howard et al.
 1999) initiated subsequent invasions of the pest throughout several other
 states within the United States and other countries (Anonymous 2006b).
 In the Pacific, CAS was first detected in Hawaii in 1998, Taiwan in 2000,
 Guam in 2003, Rota in 2007, and Palau in 2008.
 The presumed pathway for this invasive species is movement of scales attached
 to cycads in the ornamental plant trade, although accidental, long-range
 movement of scale crawlers is an alternate invasion pathway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CAS infestation on Guam progressed very rapidly.
 Initial detection in December, 2003 was on 
\shape italic
Cycas revoluta
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 growing in floral displays at the entrances to two of Guam's major hotels.
 Within a year the infestation had spread into a nearby population of wild
 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 and by 2006, the infestation was island-wide and plants had started dying
 in large numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed no pre-existing natural enemies during frequent surveys of infested
 plants.
 A predator, 
\shape italic
Rhyzobius lophanthae
\shape default
 (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and a parasitoid, Coccobius fulvus (Hymenoptera:
 Aphelinidae) were imported for CAS biocontrol during 2004 and 2005 (Moore
 et al.
 2005).
 A second parasitoid, 
\shape italic
Aphytis lignanensis
\shape default
 (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), was imported in 2012.
 The predator established rapidly.
 However, both parasitoids failed to establish in captivity and in the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
About 100 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
, were field collected on Maui, Hawaii in November 2004, flown to Guam and
 reared for one month in quarantine.
 Field releases on CAS- infested, wild 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 at Ritidian Point were initiated in February 2005.
 The beetle established immediately and its initial population explosion
 peaked in the vicinity of the release site in June 2005, when we counted
 up to 57 adults per minute in visual inspections of infested wild 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
.
 We also monitored adult beetles, scale crawlers, and male scales at Ritidian
 using a transect of yellow sticky cards.
 The resulting time series data clearly indicate collapse of the CAS population
 following introduction of the predator followed by establishment of a dynamic
 equilibrium with scale levels near the trapping detection threshold (Fig.
 1).
 Following establishment at Ritidian, more than 7,450 laboratory reared

 adults and grubs are voracious predators of CAS.
 Eggs are laid beneath female scale covers were first instar grubs consume

 Later instar grubs and adults feed on female and male scales.
 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 are currently ubiquitous throughout Guam.
 They are preventing mortality of mature cycads from scale infestation,
 but residual scales on these trees are preventing vigorous growth and seed
 production.
 More importantly, even though 
\shape italic

 lophanthae
\shape default
 are ubiquitous within their habitat, all 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 seedlings become infested with CAS and eventually die (Marler and Lawrence
 2012).
 Thus, with no reproduction occurring, health of the 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 population is still in decline.
 We offer two explanations for the partial failure of 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 as a biocontrol agent for CAS: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Marler et al.
 (2012) provide evidence that the 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 predation rate decreases near the ground.
 This at least partially explains why seedlings are more vulnerable to mortality
 from scale infestation than mature plants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 is much larger than CAS and it is not able to prey on individuals living
 in small cracks and crevices on the plant.
 CAS living in refugia provide a steady stream of crawlers which rapidly
 repopulate external surfaces of the plant during periods of low predation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We suggest that there is a urgent need to introduce one or more smaller
 biocontrol agents which are active near the ground and can follow CAS into
 its refugia.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, attempts to introduce CAS parasitoids to Guam have failed.
 A Chinese strain of 
\shape italic
Coccobius fulvus
\shape default
 from Florida was imported and released several times starting in 2005.
 On each occasion, the parasitoids died out both in the field and the laboratory
, probably out-competed by 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 (G.V.B.
 Reddy, personal communication).
 We are currently attempting to introduce 
\shape italic
Aphytis lignanensis
\shape default
 (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) which coexists with 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 as a CAS biocontrol agent in Texas (Flores and Carlson 2009) and Hawaii
 (B.
 Kumashiro, personal communication).
 In 2012, we imported about 100 
\shape italic
A.
 lignanensis
\shape default
 adults from Honolulu, Hawaii.
 These wasps were reared from CAS infesting Cycas revoluta in a home garden.
 (There are no wild cycads in Hawaii.) We put these wasps in a cage containing
 CAS-infested 
\shape italic
C.
 micronesica
\shape default
 leaves.
 We had carefully removed all visible 
\shape italic
R.
 lophanthae
\shape default
 adults and grubs from these leaves, but there were enough beetle eggs and
 first instar larvae hiding beneath scale covers to consume all scales before
 any adult wasps emerged.
 In our next attempt, we will present imported

Since writing the above abstract, there has been a fortuitous (accidental)
 introduction of a cycad scale parasitoid to Guam.
 I discovered this parasitoid, which has recently been identified as 
\shape italic
Arrhenophagus

 sp., about a year and a half ago and thought that it would not be of much
 assistance in controling CAS when I discovered that it attacks only male
 scale insects.
 However, I may have been wrong because there is circumstantial evidence
